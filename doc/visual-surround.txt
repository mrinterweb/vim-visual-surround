INTRODUCTION                                     *visual-surround*

This plugin is intended to replicate the functionality found in other editors
that automatically wrap selected text in matched opening and closing characters.

This plugin was influenced by Tim Pope's vim-surround. vim-surround is much more
feature rich than this plugin.
